# Detecting Plagiarism between documents using Locality Sensitive Hashing

This project was developed as part of my Master's Course Study in Algorithms and Methods for Big Data Analytics

Authors: Prudhviraj Sheela

The main motive of this project is to understand the process of how do we estimate the approximate or exeact Near Neighbor Search in high dimensional spaces. The process flow includes 3 steps which are Shingling, Min Hashing and LSH to identify similar documents.

IDE Used: Google Colab Notebook

Language Used: Python
